# Writing Samples

In my six years as a Technical Writer at Scaleway, I have had the opportunity to write documentation for different products and work on several types of documentation. You can find examples of content I worked on below.

## API Documentation
As a Technical Writer at Scaleway, I am not responsible for creating the APIs, but I am responsible for ensuring the description of path, request, response and body parameters, and other elements of the API reference. I am also responsible for writing the introductions you see at the beginning of the page, including the quickstart tutorial.

- [Managed Database for PostgreSQL and MySQL API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/managed-database-postgre-mysql/)
- [IAM API - Scaleway Developers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/iam/)
- [Scaleway Managed Database for Redis™ API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/managed-database-redis/)
- [Scaleway Container Registry API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/registry/)

## User Interface Documentation
Documentation of Scaleway products, i.e. how to use and manage them in the graphic interface: the Scaleway console. Different content types, such as concepts, how-tos, reference content, and API/CLI tutorials are available to help users understand and use the products.

## User Testimonials
For a year, at the beginning of my technical writing career, I carried out user interviews to create testimonials of success stories. I no longer work on these, as the scope of my team evolved, and is now mainly focused on technical copy.
